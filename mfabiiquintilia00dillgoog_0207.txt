116. 19. Amhololie Cicereio one of his letters
to Atticus (ii. 23) says: “ Quom recreando occule

119. 30. Borboront, Groecrrmoe. A proverbial
expression, used in reference to one who pronoen·
ces Letin incorrectly, ss e foreigner or Greek. ln
his first book, § 16, our author seys, “A bey
should not epply himself so scropulously to Greek
essorelong tirno to rpeek no other toogoo end
hove no other stody, es is generally the cese3 be.
ceuse such e practice gives riso to grent scelte in
our own pronunciation end longooge, both which
Α ere thereby vitioted by e foreign cest3 for when
we contrecto habit 01 speaking in the Greek idiote,
it is elrnost irrernoveble, ond gives e wrong turn to
our speaking of Letin. The study of the Letin
lenguege ought therefore soon te follow thot of the
Greek, end in e short time they ought to keep poce
together, end then by giving to both en equel de·
gree of attention, neither will hert the other.” ..
